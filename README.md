# Personal website

This repository is the source code for my [personal website][pw]. The site is
generated by `gensite.py`, a program based on [makesite.py][ms] (which is a very
bare-bones static site generator).

## Dependencies

To generate the site all you need is Python 3 and the markdown library (install
with `pip3 install markdown`).

## Other notes

The font used for the logo is "Libre Baskerville" in bold.
