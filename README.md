# Personal website

This repository is the source code for my [personal website][pw]. The site is
generated by `gensite.py`, a program based on [makesite.py][ms] (which is a very
bare-bones static site generator).

## Dependencies

To generate the site all you need is Python 3 and the markdown library (install
with `pip3 install markdown`).

## Other notes

The font used for the logo is "Libre Baskerville" in bold. The `woff2` file used
for the font only includes the needed letters for the logo ("BOacdeinorst") to
keep the file size small (2.5 KiB). To create such file, you can use the
following command:

```sh
pyftsubset LibreBaskerville-Bold.ttf \
  --unicodes=U+004F,U+0073,U+0063,U+0061,U+0072,U+0042,U+0065,U+006E,U+0064,U+0069,U+0074,U+006F \
  --output-file=<output-font-file>.woff2 --flavor=woff2
```

You might need to run `pip3 install fonttools brotli` to install the
dependencies.
