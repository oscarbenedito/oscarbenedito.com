<p>
  Running a personal Git server is something that has been on my mind for quite a long time. One of
  the most popular solutions I have seen around is <a href="https://gitea.io">Gitea</a>. A couple of
  months ago, when trying out different things, I decided to run Gitea locally to see how easy it
  would be to implement on my server. It turns out pretty easy, especially if you are using Docker.
  However, my server doesn't run Docker as of now and it also felt like customizing it would be hard
  (for example, getting rid of the username in the URLs). Gitea looks like a very good solution for
  self-hosting Git (and the sites look very nice!), but in my case, it felt like using a
  sledgehammer to crack a nut. I figured most self-hosted Git solutions would turn out to be a bit
  too much for my use case, so I decided to look into hosting Git without any other program.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  I had experience setting up a bare-bones Git server only usable through SSH, so I looked up how to
  create a website with the <code>bare</code> repositories. It turns out there's even a built-in
  option<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>! Other programs have more or less similar looks,
  but I decided to check if there was any way to have a static generator for the webpage—the fewer
  things running on my server the better! And there is one (that I found):
  <a href="https://codemadness.org/stagit.html">stagit</a>. It is very simple, and it does the job.
  On top of that, the program is super small, which makes it very easy to modify it if needed<sup
  id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. I gave it a try and it worked nicely. I decided that it
  was a good solution for my use case, therefore having a vanilla Git server would work, so I
  started building it<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3">3</a></sup>.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>Let's see how to set it up!</p>

<h2>Setting up a Git server</h2>

<p>
  What will happen is we'll have <code>bare</code> repositories on our server which we'll then
  clone/fetch/push to using SSH<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4">4</a></sup>. We'll put these
  repositories on the <code>/srv/git</code> directory—because I keep everything served from my
  server on <code>/srv</code>—but any location will work. To keep Git separated from the root user,
  we'll create a new <code>git</code> user, with <code>/srv/git</code> as its home folder, this way,
  the remote address will be <code>git@domain:repo.git</code> (no need for an absolute address).
  Let's do that:</p>
<!-- /p -->

<pre><code><!--
     -->useradd -d /srv/git git
<!-- -->mkdir /srv/git
<!-- -->chown git /srv/git</code></pre>

<p>Now, let's create the folder for the SSH configuration where we'll add our public key.</p>

<pre><code><!--
     -->su git
<!-- -->cd
<!-- -->mkdir .ssh &amp;&amp; chmod 700 .ssh
<!-- -->touch .ssh/authorized_keys &amp;&amp; chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys</code></pre>

<p>
  We could stop here, adding our key to the file (you can also use <code>ssh-copy-id</code>), but we
  can take a couple more steps to isolate the user from the server, useful especially if you want to
  share access to the git user with someone else.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  To do that, we'll use the <code>git-shell</code> shell, which will only run scripts found on
  <code>~/git-shell-commands</code>.<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5">5</a></sup></p>
<!-- /p -->

<pre><code>chsh git -s $(which git-shell)</code></pre>

<p>
  Now if you add someone else's public SSH key to the server, they won't be able to run any command.
  If you want to allow some commands, create scripts on <code>~/git-shell-commands</code>. For
  example, I have scripts to initiate repositories, add SSH keys and other useful commands, you can
  see them all <a href="https://git.oscarbenedito.com/git-shell-commands/">here</a>.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<h2>Making repositories public</h2>

<p>
  Now we can pull and push to our repository, and we can share access to them by adding SSH keys (or
  sharing the password if you use one). However, we might want to have public repositories that
  people should be able to clone without the need to have access to all of them. To do so, we'll use
  the Git Daemon (that uses the Git Protocol). All we have to do is run the following command (and
  keep it running, I recommend running a systemd service if you use systemd, there is an example
  <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-on-the-Server-Git-Daemon">here</a>).</p>
<!-- /p -->

<pre><code>git daemon --reuseaddr --base-path=/srv/git/ /srv/git/</code></pre>

<p>
  This daemon will only serve repositories that have a file named <code>git-daemon-export-ok</code>
  in them, so if you want to make a certain repository public, all you have to do is run:</p>
<!-- /p -->

<pre><code>touch /srv/git/repo.git/git-daemon-export-ok</code></pre>

<p>
  Remove that file to make it private again. The cloning address will be
  <code>git://domain/repo.git</code> and you can't push to that address. You can also serve
  repositories through HTTP which will allow you to have fine-grained control over who can access
  which repositories, look it up if you are interested.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<h2>Making a website</h2>

<p>
  Now we can host private and public repositories, but we may want to share the public ones easily.
  A website is a good way to allow people to quickly see your repositories without the need to clone
  every single one of them. We'll use stagit to create the HTML files which we'll host as a static
  site. First of all, let's install stagit:</p>
<!-- /p -->

<pre><code><!--
     -->git clone git://git.codemadness.org/stagit
<!-- -->cd stagit
<!-- -->sudo make install</code></pre>

<p>To create a website for a repository run</p>

<pre><code>stagit /path/to/repo.git</code></pre>

<p>from the directory where you want the site built. To create an index file with all your repositories simply run</p>

<pre><code>stagit-index /path/to/repo-1.git /path/to/repo-2.git &gt; index.html</code></pre>

<p>
  with the path to all your repositories. Make sure you have the correct information on the
  <code>owner</code>, <code>description</code> and <code>url</code> files so that stagit uses them
  when creating the HTML.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  Having to do this is every time you update your repositories is not a reasonable solution, but we
  can set up a <code>post-receive</code> hook to do it for us. There are examples of scripts to use
  as an initial creation script for the whole site and a post-receive hook on stagit's source code
  repository. I have changed those scripts a bit to only process public repositories (the ones with
  the <code>git-daemon-export-ok</code> file) as well a modified the source a bit. You can find the
  changes on my <a href="https://git.oscarbenedito.com/stagit/">stagit fork</a>.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<h2>Pros of this setup</h2>

<p>
  I have only been using this server for a couple of days, but I have also been setting up a bunch
  of <a href="https://suckless.org">suckless</a> tools<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6">6</a></sup>,
  so I have been using Git a lot. One of the best things is that setting up repositories is very
  easy. No need to open a browser, log in to GitHub and go through the process of creating a new
  repository<sup id="fnref7"><a href="#fn7">7</a></sup>. I just run</p>
<!-- /p -->

<pre><code><!--
     -->ssh git@oscarbenedito.com
<!-- -->init reponame</code></pre>

<p>
  Done! I can also set it up as public by running a script I have on my <code>git-shell</code> and
  change the description/owner/url just as easily.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  Another thing I have noticed is that Git's clone/fetch/push commands are significantly faster on
  this server than GitLab or GitHub. However, I don't know compared to a self-hosted instance of
  Gitea or <a href="https://gogs.io">Gogs</a>.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<h2>Cons of this setup</h2>

<p>
  One thing that might be missed by this setup is the ability to download a tarball with the code
  from a certain commit, browse the code as it was in a given commit, see git blame, etc. This could
  be solved by using another tool for the website part—such as <a
  href="https://git.zx2c4.com/cgit/about/">cgit</a>—so if I ever want to do that, it shouldn't be hard.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  Another thing is how the website looks. Other self-hosting solutions like Gogs, Gitea, GitLab...
  look a lot nicer than stagit. However this isn't a priority right now and I appreciate the ability
  to have full control over how the server works—and it has been very interesting to learn about it
  all. Once again this is something to do with the website, and not the repository hosting
  itself.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<h2>Final comments</h2>

<p>
  It has been fun to set everything up and realize how easy it is to self-host Git without the need
  for other software. On top of that, I can now share my repositories from my domain, which means it
  is easier to stop using other hosting services if I stop wanting to accept their policies, similar
  to having email on my domain.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  For now, I will still have my public repositories hosted on GitLab and GitHub, as I don't mind it
  and some people might be more used to those UIs. They also act as a backup in case something
  happens to my server or if I want to edit my repositories from a computer without SSH access to my
  server.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  Finally, I have talked about some software that will allow you to self-host Git, but I don't want
  to end this post without mentioning <a href="https://sourcehut.org/">sourcehut</a>. I find it a
  very good solution because everyone can contribute to your projects without the need to create yet
  another account. Everything is done through email, which is nicely supported by Git (learn more
  <a href="https://git-send-email.io/">here</a>).</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  I almost forgot! If you want to check out my Git website or clone some repositories from my
  domain, you can find all of that here: <a href="https://git.oscarbenedito.com">https://git.oscarbenedito.com</a>.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  <em>Edit</em>: The post originally said that creating a new repository on GitLab was a long
  process. However, you can just push to a new remote address and GitLab will automatically create
  the new repository.</p>

    Funnily enough, I had already set up a Git server there for a couple of repositories containing
    a lot of personal information to avoid hosting them on GitLab or GitHub. I completely forgot

    Bare repositories are simply a folder with the files of the <code>.git</code> directory of a
    repository. Indeed, you can clone a repository from your computer running <code>git clone
    /path/to/repo/.git cloned-repo</code>. This directory contains all the information of the
    repository, that is why Git is distributed. <a href="#fnref4" title="Jump back to footnote 4 in

    Fun fact: after setting everything up I realized that suckless uses stagit to show their
