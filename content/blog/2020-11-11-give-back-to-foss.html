  Most people make use of free and open source software—or services based on it—that is made
  available to the public for free. And I mean free, not services that you pay with your data, but
  those that are truly free of cost. Projects that rely on donations, grants, and the resources of
  the maintainers (and most of the time it's only the latter). If you are a heavy user of FOSS, you
  are probably already aware of this, but even if you are not a big user, you probably still use
  Wikipedia (or other sites based on the same engine), the VLC media player, or others.</p>

  These programs are great, not only because they are universally affordable (have no cost!), but
  because they are focused on the user. Their goal is to serve the user, not the developer, which
  often involves software that is more private, useful and easy to adapt to your needs. Software
  that doesn't break after a couple of years, and that keeps working even on older devices.</p>

  But this post is not about how great FOSS is, but about helping out these projects. All projects
  have a cost, if there is no monetary cost, then there must be people behind it contributing their
  time and energy. If you regularly enjoy some of this software, consider giving back to the
  developers. This kind of project normally requires a lot fewer resources than commercial ones, and
  even then, the maintainers normally carry most of the burden. By helping out, we can enlarge the
  community and have more people working on it, as well as help current projects grow. How can we
  help? Glad you asked!</p>

  <li>
    <strong>Donate</strong>: It's easy, doesn't require a lot of your resources, and it helps. My
    biggest issue is normally convenience. If every time that I have the thought "this is very
    useful, I should donate", I could press a button to give 2 euros, I would probably do it. The
    problem is that there is no such convenient button. My most successful strategy has been
    thinking about a handful of projects I wanted to donate to, and then sit down on my computer and
    donate a bigger amount to each one of them. This way I only have to do it once every so many
    months, instead of a little donation every two weeks.</li>

  <li>
    <strong>Report bugs</strong>: Instead of complaining that something doesn't work, take some time
    to make sure it's something about the program (not just you messing up) and, if it is, go to the
    project's bug tracker and either provide more details to an already open issue or file a new one
    if you can't find it there. This is can be more time-consuming depending on the bug, but it's
    free (except for the time you pay, of course :)).</li>
  <!-- /li -->
  <li>
    <strong>Translate</strong>: This one takes even more time! Is that program not in your native
    language? Translate it yourself!</li>
  <!-- /li -->
  <li>
    <strong>Send patches</strong>: If you want a new feature, there is an annoying bug, etc.,
    consider jumping into the code and implement it/solve it on your own (or asking for some help
    doing it).</li>
  <!-- /li -->
</ul>

<p>
  There are other ways to help (feel free to contact me if you think of more and I'll add them), but
  these are the ones that come to mind. I partially wanted the post to be a reminder that donating
  money and coding are not the only ways to help. In particular, reporting bugs is something most
  users will be able to do and it helps—you can't fix it if you don't know about it. On the other
  hand, depending on the project, such bugs will get fixed in a matter of days, so you'll be able to
  reap the benefit.</p>
