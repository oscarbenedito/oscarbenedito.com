  When we are trying to understand a communications network, having an approximate image of how the
  network operates can be very valuable. Do all communications go through the same node? Is there a
  central authority? Can nodes communicate directly with each other? Depending on how the network
  operates, we can classify it as centralized, decentralized or distributed.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<h2>Centralized networks</h2>

<p>
  When all the nodes on a network are connected to one unique node, we call it a centralized
  network. All communications happen through that one "master" node. An example of a centralized
  network is the one created by most instant messengers, for example <a href="https://signal.org/">Signal</a>.
  Every time we send a message, it goes to Signal's servers and it is then sent to its destination.
  This creates a network similar to the following, where everyone is connected to one server (or
  cluster of servers).</p>

  Having everything go through the same computer has its pros and cons. On the one hand, it makes
  deployment easier and faster, data consistency is easy to maintain and it is an efficient network
  (if, for instance, you need to gather data, it is all in one server). On the other hand, it
  creates a single point of failure for the whole network (which also facilitates censorship) and it
  makes it easier to abuse users (as the central server has a monopoly over the network)<sup

  the resources are provided by one sole party.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<h2>Decentralized networks</h2>

<p>
  Decentralized networks don't have one central node, but multiple of them, which are connected
  between themselves. When clients connect to the network, their communications go through their
  "master" node, to the destination's "master" node, and finally to the destination. An example of a
  decentralized network is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Email">e-mail</a>. When Alice
  (<code>alice@example.com</code>) wants to send an e-mail to Bob (<code>bob@example.org</code>),
  Alice's computer sends the message to <code>example.com</code>'s server. From there, it is sent to
  <code>example.org</code>, and finally <code>example.org</code> sends it to Bob's computer. A
  decentralized network looks similar to the following network.</p>

<p>
  Decentralized networks solve some of the centralization problems: no entity has control over the
  whole network anymore, allowing users to choose between different providers and switch servers (or
  self-host) if one starts abusing its power. If a server is down, others can still communicate
  ordinarily, which also makes censorship more difficult. Decentralized networks are also easier to
  escalate. Nonetheless, this type of network requires more infrastructure and can become less
  efficient for certain operations (like global tasks). It is also harder to deploy updates, as
  servers might update at different times, when each administrator decides to do so.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<h2>Distributed networks</h2>

<p>
  Distributed networks only have one type of node, and they are connected with each other (although
  not necessarily all with all). This creates a very robust network where all nodes are client and
  server at the same time. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent">BitTorrent
  protocol</a> is an example of a protocol that works with a distributed network. The following
  image shows what a distributed network looks like.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><svg class="basic-svg" viewBox="0 0 633.9 523.77"><use xlink:href="/img/blog/2020/03/types-of-networks/distributed-network.svg#l"></use></svg></p>

<p>
  Because there are no central servers, distributed networks easily circumvent censorship and are
  practically immune to denial-of-service attacks. Since every user is client and server at the same
  time, these networks are highly scalable without the need for additional central resources.
  However, distributed networks make deployment a lot harder.</p>

<h2>Final comments</h2>

<p>
  I hope this post has clarified the main differences between centralized, decentralized and
  distributed networks as well as showed some applications for each of them. In the future, I might
  refer to this post when talking about services and the type of network they rely on.</p>

    This is pretty usual. Whether it is services selling user's data, censoring content, a sudden
    rise of prices, etc., when dealing with centralized services, users don't have much choice but
    to leave the network completely (which might not be affordable). <a href="#fnref1" title="Jump
