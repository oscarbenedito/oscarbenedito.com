<p>
  Now that my website is <a href="/blog/2019/11/new-host/">hosted by Autistici/Inventati</a>, I can
  no longer deploy it by just pushing my git repository's changes to GitLab, as I used to. In order
  to deploy my website, I need to access the server using the WebDAV protocol. To do so, I use <a
  href="https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/davfs2">davfs2</a>—which mounts the WebDAV resource—so
  I can access it like any other folder in the filesystem.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  I had never used the WebDAV protocol before, so I used A/I's tutorial. It was was a very simple
  tutorial, but it goes straight to the point, without giving unneeded explanations. I set it all up
  and edited the <code>~/.davfs2/secrets</code> file to make the mounting process smother. I know
  that having a password in plain text is a potential security risk, but the password only gives
  access to the WebDAV service (not my whole A/I account) and is easily resettable. If someone got
  hold of the password, all they could do is change my website, until I realized it and change
  it.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  Deploying the website would mean copying all the output files from <a
  href="https://gohugo.io">Hugo</a>—the static site generator used to build my site—to the specified
  folder on the mounted filesystem. The problem was that copying files (as well as removing them)
  takes a long time, I am guessing due to A/I's resources' configuration. To give some context, it
  took around 1 minute to copy 1MiB worth of files, plus 10 seconds to delete them. So deleting and
  copying the whole folder again every time I changed something wasn't a good deploying method
  (besides, it wastes resources server-side).</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  The solution I chose was <a href="https://rsync.samba.org">rsync</a>. It is a great piece of
  software that efficiently transfers files from one folder to another. It checks the last
  modification time and the file size to avoid transferring files that are up to date. I already
  knew this program as I use it to back up my computers to hard drives (it reduces the backup time
  considerably after the first time), so implementing it should have been a breeze. I encountered
  two problems:</p>
<!-- /p -->

<ol>
  <li>
    By default, <code>rsync</code> makes use of modification times to check whether a file should be
    transferred, but every time I build my site, all files are created again, so the modification
    times are always newer than the ones in the server.<br/>

    There is a quick fix for this: the program has an option (<code>-c</code> or
    <code>--checksum</code>) that makes the program use the checksum of a file (instead of
    the modification time) along with the file size to determine whether it has
    changed.</li>
  <!-- /li -->
  <li>
    <code>rsync</code> makes use of auxiliary files while synchronizing them. For some reason (that
    I still don't know, my guess is something to do with permissions), when those auxiliary files
    are finally renamed to the definitive filename, it fails, giving out an error and exiting
    without any file transferred.<br/>

    To fix this issue, I used the <code>--temp-dir</code> option to specify a local directory as the
    one that should be used for the temporary files. With that set up, it doesn't give any more
    errors.</li>
  <!-- /li -->
</ol>

<p>
  So finally the <code>rsync</code> command worked, and the time used to update the website is now
  around 10 seconds, which is a lot better than a minute (considering my website might get larger,
  the impact can be even bigger). To automate the process I build a little script that will mount
  the filesystem, build the site, synchronize it with the server and unmount it again:</p>
<!-- /p -->

<pre><code class="language-bash"><!--
     -->#!/bin/bash

<!-- -->HUGO_PATH=&quot;{path_to_hugo_directory}&quot;
<!-- -->TEMP_DIR=&quot;{path_to_temp_directory_to_use_with_rsync}&quot;
<!-- -->MOUNT_PATH=&quot;{path_to_the_mounted_directory}&quot;
<!-- -->WEBDAV_FOLDER=&quot;{website_directory_in_webdav_filesystem}&quot;

<!-- -->rm -rf $HUGO_PATH/public
<!-- -->hugo -s $HUGO_PATH --minify
<!-- -->mount $MOUNT_PATH
<!-- -->mkdir $TEMP_DIR
<!-- -->rsync -ruvc --progress --delete --temp-dir=$TEMP_DIR $HUGO_PATH/public/ $MOUNT_PATH/$WEBDAV_FOLDER
<!-- -->rmdir $TEMP_DIR
<!-- -->umount $MOUNT_PATH</code></pre>

<p>
  As you can see, it is a very simple script. It removes the last built of the site from the local
  filesystem and builds it again (using the <code>--minify</code> option to reduce file sizes), it
  mounts the WebDAV resource, transfers the files and then unmounts the resource again.</p>
