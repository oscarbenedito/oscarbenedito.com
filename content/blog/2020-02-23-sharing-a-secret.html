  Making a backup of a secret can be tricky. For instance: I have a lot of passwords stored in an
  encrypted file, which I can edit through my password manager. The data in that file is both very
  sensitive and crucial. I currently have some offline backups (which are updated every once in a
  while) in different locations and one online backup in case I lose access to my passwords and I am
  not able to go to one of the locations where other backups are kept.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  The problem with having an online backup is that such sensitive data must be kept away from
  untrusted third parties and, so far, there's no third party I would trust with all those
  passwords. My solution is to distribute the trust. The encrypted file is encrypted again multiple
  times with very long random passwords. Those passwords are distributed across different services,
  and the file in another one, so no one service has access to the encrypted file.</p>

  This seems like a reasonably secure system (considering the diversity of parties that should agree
  to attack me/get hacked). However, a couple of days ago, I was introduced to a much simpler and
  convenient method to "distribute" a secret: <a

<h2>Shamir's Secret Sharing</h2>

<p>
  Shamir's Secret Sharing was created by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adi_Shamir">Adi
  Shamir</a>, a cryptographer who is also the co-inventor of the—probably more widely known—<a
  href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)">RSA algorithm</a> (yes, that S stands for
  Shamir!). Here, I'll try to briefly explain how it works.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  Given a secret \(S\) (coded as a number), we want to distribute it among \(n\) parties (giving
  each party a "share" of the secret) in such a way that only \(k \leq n\) shares are needed to
  retrieve the secret, but that \(k-1\) shares don't grant any kind of knowledge on \(S\).</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  Shamir's method is based on the fact that given \(n + 1\) pairs \((x_i, y_i)\) such that \(i \neq
  j \implies x_i \neq x_j\), then there exists a unique polynomial \(p\) of degree \(n\) or less
  that satisfies that \(p(x_i) = y_i\), \(\forall i \in \{1, \dots, n\}\) (and we have an efficient
  method to find \(p\) given \(n\) points).</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  Let's put it into practice. Given a secret \(S\), to be shared with \(n\) parties in a way that
  any \(k\) parties can retrieve it, we'll build the following polynomial:</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>\[p(x) = S + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + ... + a_{k-1} x^{k-1},\]</p>

<p>
  where \(a_i\) are random numbers, \(\forall i \in \{1, \dots, k-1\}\). Now we'll evaluate our
  polynomial on \(n\) different points (and different from 0) to obtain \(n\) pairs of the form
  \((x_i, p(x_i))\). This will be the shares of the secret. Each party will get one share. We know
  that \(k\) shares define a unique polynomial \(p\) of degree \(k-1\), (if we find it, we'll find
  \(S\)). On the other hand, there are an infinite amount of polynomials of degree \(k-1\) that
  interpolate \(k-1\) points, so the secret cannot be easily obtained by gaining access to \(k-1\)
  shares<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  If we want to recover the secret from \(k\) shares, we can interpolate the \(k\) points \((x_i,
  p(x_i))\) using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrange_polynomial">Lagrange's form for
  the interpolation polynomial</a><sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>:</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>\[p(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{k} p(x_i) l_i(x),\]</p>

<p>where</p>

<p>
  \[l_i(x) = \prod_{\begin{smallmatrix}1\leq m\leq k\ m\neq i\end{smallmatrix}}
  \frac{x-x_m}{x_i-x_m}.\]</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>Now, evaluating on \(x = 0\) we'll find the secret (because \(p(0) = S\)).</p>

<h2>Final notes</h2>

<p>
  Now we have a method to share our secret between multiple parties and being able to retrieve it
  with only some of them. This method is not too hard to code yourself, however, there are
  implementations online if you would rather not do that (make sure you are running trusted
  code!).</p>

    This is not completely true when working with positive integers, but it can be solved by working
    with finite fields. <a href="#fnref1" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></li>

    Let's quickly prove that the \(p\) defined in Lagrange's form (\(\bar{p}\) from now on) is the
    same as the previously defined \(p\). \(\bar{p}\) is clearly a polynomial of degree (at most)
    \(k-1\), since it is the sum of polynomials of degree \(k-1\), so we only need to prove that it
    interpolates the points given (we'll asume that the fact that there is only one polynomial of
    degree at most \(k-1\) that interpolates \(k\) points is true). That is easy to prove since \(i
    \neq j \implies l_i(x_j) = 0\) and \(l_i(x_i) = 1\), therefore having \(\bar{p}(x_i) = p(x_i)
    l_i(x_i) = p(x_i)\). <a href="#fnref2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></li>
