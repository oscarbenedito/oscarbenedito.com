  Oh no! Another <a href="https://www.vim.org/">vim</a> post! Well... yes. I have seen a lot of
  people criticizing vim before even trying it, so I am going to try and explain my history with it
  and what I like about it. If you aren't aware, vim is a text editor that is normally used from the
  command line (and, normally, the mouse doesn't work in it or is deactivated).</p>

<h2>Getting into vim</h2>

<p>
  When I first saw people that got around a computer with the keyboard, I realized how much faster
  you can do stuff when you don't use your mouse. By that time, I used the copy/cut/paste shortcuts
  and that was pretty much it, I didn't even use <code>Alt</code>+<code>Tab</code> to change between
  windows, so I was mindblown when I saw people moving around so quickly without touching the mouse.
  For me, the keyboard was simply a tool to write text.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  Although I realized that being more familiar with the keyboard would make me more efficient, it
  was hard to get used to it. I had to think before every keystroke, and everything was very slow.
  GNU/Linux helped a lot with getting more used to the keyboard, not only did I use a couple more
  shortcuts, but I also found myself using the terminal often.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  At some point, a friend introduced me to vim. I remember<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>
  seeing such a weird program—and in the terminal!—and thinking: why would anyone use that?! I was
  told that there were a lot of shortcuts, and experienced programmers could move through a file
  very quickly with it, as well as do complex operations with the file contents. I believed it, but
  I didn't want to spend years mastering vim, so I kept going with a simpler text editor. A couple
  of months later, I had a programming class where the teacher would sometimes show us his screen
  while writing solutions to exercises. He was fast, very fast. He moved around the file very
  quickly and the craziest part was that he was using Geany. All that speed was reached with
  <code>Home</code>, <code>End</code>, arrow keys, etc. No <em>real</em> shortcuts. I think that is
  the point in time when I understood what a program focused on keyboard shortcuts (like vim) had to
  offer.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  Since then, I have tried vim many times and, truth be told, it is hard to start with. I also
  didn't code a lot during certain times, and when I had to, I just wanted to get stuff done, so
  finding times to figure out vim wasn't as easy. Another friend recommended using vim when editing
  Latex files because of a plugin. I was creating Latex documents for some classes so I used vim for
  a while to edit those files<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. This is how I started to
  be able to do some things in vim. I eventually started managing servers and used it more and
  finally, at the start of the confinement, I decided to use it exclusively. It took some time
  adjusting to it, but I haven't opened any other editor except for a couple of occasions.</p>

<h2>What I like about vim</h2>

<p>
  The first thing that I like is that it is a modal editor, meaning it has modes: you are always on
  one mode, and the editor responds differently to keypresses depending on the mode. The two most
  basic modes are normal and insert. Insert mode responds to keypresses like you would expect from a
  text editor: if you press <code>x</code>, an <code>x</code> is appended to the file you are
  editing, and so on. Normal mode, however, will not print the letter you just typed. For instance,
  if you press <code>x</code> the letter under the cursor will be deleted, and if you press <code>w</code>
  the cursor will move to the first character of the next word. This is great because there are a
  lot of shortcuts on normal mode that are incredibly useful, and let you move around the document
  without the need of leaving the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_row">home row</a> or
  pressing modifier keys.</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  Now, normal mode has a ridiculous amount of shortcuts, each key has some behavior assigned to it,
  so it can be hard to learn it all. In the end, it is only a matter of practice and it is easier
  than it looks like. On top of that, these shortcuts act like a language, which makes them really
  powerful. With that, I mean that shortcuts can be mixed to create new shortcuts. It is hard to
  explain and there are a lot of explanations online, so I will refer you to two sources, and you
  can keep investigating if you are interested:</p>

</ul>

<p>
  This is it for me. The fact that you can do so many things with the keyboard without the need to
  keep <code>Ctrl</code> or <code>Alt</code> pressed and do them in such a natural "language" is
  what makes vim the best editor I have tried so far. Of course, you can make other editors behave
  like vim (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vi">vi</a> really), but vim is the best one I've
  tried. Well... I actually use <a href="https://neovim.io/">neovim</a>, but for my use-case, I
  probably wouldn't be able to tell them apart.</p>

<h2>Final comments</h2>

<p>
  There are still a lot of things left for me to learn about vim, especially when dealing with a
  project with lots of files, but I am now more comfortable with vim than with a normal editor where
  you move around using the mouse.</p>

<p>
  As you can see from this post, what I appreciate the most of vim is how it behaves, so I could
  easily change to another editor that would copy this behavior and add other features. It is useful
  that it is run on the terminal, as it is normally how I move around the computer, but I don't have
  anything against other editors. I also want to try <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a>
  again at some point (with <a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Evil">Evil mode</a>, of
  course), we'll see how that goes!</p>

    This is how I remember it, but it was—I think—three years ago, so it might not be completely

    The plugin is really nice (especially when writing big amounts of text), but I was so
    uncomfortable with vim that I would write everything in vim and then edit/review it with a
    different editor. <a href="#fnref2" title="Jump back to footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a>
