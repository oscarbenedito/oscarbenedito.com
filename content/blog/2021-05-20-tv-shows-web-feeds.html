  I am quite strict about which messages make it to a push notification on my phone. I don't like to
  receive notifications unless they are important or urgent. The same thing happens with emails—indeed,
  it's one of the few applications which have notifications enabled. However, I also don't want to
  regularly check different places for updates. Because of this, most of the updates I receive are
  through another channel: web feeds.</p>

  <a href="/blog/2020/04/use-web-feeds/">I have written before</a> about using web feeds (Atom, RSS,
  JSON feed...) to keep track of updates to sites. I use my feed reader to get updates about some of
  the software I use, YouTube videos, newsletters, and, of course, blogs. They are all things I
  don't want to miss out on, but I don't want to be notified about. Instead, Miniflux (my feed
  reader) stores them until I decide to log in and read them. This allows me to disable any
  notifications but have them all centralized in one place.</p>

  Lately, many TV shows are starting to air again, meaning that there are new episodes weekly of
  some series that I am watching, and soon more will follow. Because of this, I want to keep up to
  date with which TV series are coming up, but I don't want push notifications or emails (or
  checking their websites). I just want a way to know that there are new episodes for me to watch,
  but without the hassle of looking it up... Ring a bell? Web feeds!</p>

  Yesterday I quickly looked around to see if there was any service offering that for free or
  cheaply, and there was none. The ones I saw were about 5€/month, which is more than any other
  service I use (a small VPS, email provider or Miniflux). I was not willing to pay that much, and I
  was motivated enough to do such a service myself, it sounded like a fun and easy project to take
  on for a day or two, so I did.</p>

<p>
  Luckily, <a href="https://www.tvmaze.com">TVmaze</a> offers a free API with all the information I
  needed, and there I went with a Python script. After some time, I had it running, and today I
  polished it a bit. I can say it is fully working now!</p>
<!-- /p -->

<p>
  The script takes TV series IDs (as many as you want) and creates an Atom feed with an entry for
  each episode there is. Just run it as a cron job every hour and put the output on a static site,
  you're done! Alternatively, you can make one feed per show, so multiple people can subscribe to
  their desired shows.</p>
