  I use <a href="https://codemadness.org/stagit.html">stagit</a> to show the public repositories of
  my Git server on the web. I chose stagit because it is a very simple and lightweight tool, which
  makes tinkering with the source code very straightforward (which I have been doing a bit lately)
  and because the resulting website is static: easy to set up, faster, and there aren't any
  application-specific issues (there is no application). Static sites are also nice because you know
  exactly what is going on when a page is requested—the file is served—, whereas if it is a dynamic
  site, you might or might not know what operations the server is doing to answer the request.</p>

  Stagit doesn't have many features. This isn't necessarily bad, as it keeps the source small and
  readable and it still does everything I consider necessary, it even has an Atom feed for commits!
  The one feature I really missed was being able to show an about page with the repository's readme
  file when it is opened<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. For me, it is a basic feature,
  especially with repositories for projects without a website/wiki. When I hear about a piece of
  software, the first I do is go check out the repository and read a bit about it, and readme files
  make that easier. Since most of my repositories have readmes written in Markdown, I wanted stagit
  to convert them to HTML, so they could be shown nicely on the repositories' website.</p>

  If you want to try it out yourself, the change on stagit is very simple, just a couple of lines,
  but it will add a dependency to the program<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2">2</a></sup>. I use
  <a href="https://github.com/mity/md4c">md4c</a> to parse the files, and it is ridiculously fast. I
  haven't noticed any changes in the time it takes for stagit to run. Check out
  <a href="https://git.oscarbenedito.com/stagit/commit/1fdbc7e8ef4025e50678261ca670daca85ac298c.html">this
  commit</a> if you want to know how I did it, and feel free to suggest other approaches if you
  think they are better.</p>

  <li id="fn1">
    Stagit has a link on the navigation bar to the readme file, and you could easily make that the
    default <code>index.html</code> file, but it is just the page with the raw file (as any other
    file is shown), it isn't presented like an about page. <a href="#fnref1" title="Jump back to
    footnote 1 in the text">&#8617;</a></li>
  <!-- /li -->
  <li id="fn2">
    The dependency is only for parsing Markdown, if you don't need that, you can just show the raw
    file without the line numbers and metadata, this is what
    <a href="https://git.oscarbenedito.com/stagit/commit/1fdbc7e8ef4025e50678261ca670daca85ac298c.html#h5-5-16">I
    do</a> when the readme file isn't a Markdown file. <a href="#fnref2" title="Jump back to
    footnote 2 in the text">&#8617;</a></li>
