<!-- description: Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Oscar Benedito and this is my corner of the Internet. -->

Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Oscar Benedito and I am a
24-year-old from Barcelona. I enjoy tinkering with and customizing computers and
I often undertake small software projects for personal use. When away from a
computer, I like to do sport (the particular sport varies depending on the
season and year) and I occasionally juggle. Last year I graduated in Mathematics
and Computer Engineering from [UPC][upc] and I am currently working as an
Associate Software Engineer at Oracle.

I encourage you to check out some of my content: [my blog][blog], where I talk
about privacy, software and other related topics, or [my Git repositories][git]
(which are mirrored on [SourceHut][sh] and [GitHub][gh]). If you want to read
more about my academic/professional life, check out [my LinkedIn profile][li].
