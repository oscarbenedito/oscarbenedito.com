Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Oscar Benedito and I am currently
pursuing a double degree in Mathematics and Computer Engineering at the
[Interdisciplinary Higher Education Center (CFIS)][cfis] from [UPC][upc]. I am
passionate about cryptography, computer security and distributed technologies.
Aside from technology, I also like doing sport (the particular sport varies
depending on the season and year) and I juggle.

I encourage you to check out some of my content: [my blog][blog], where I talk
about privacy, software and other related topics, or [my Git repositories][git]
(which are mirrored on [GitLab][gl] and [GitHub][gh]). If you want to read more
about my academic/professional life, check out [my LinkedIn profile][li].
