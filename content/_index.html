<!-- description: Hello and welcome to my website! I'm Oscar Benedito and this is my corner of the Internet. -->

<p>
  Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Oscar Benedito and I am a 25-year-old from Barcelona.
  I enjoy tinkering with and customizing computers and I often undertake small software projects for
  personal use. When away from a computer, I like to do sport (the particular sport varies depending
  on the season and year) and I occasionally juggle. I graduated in Mathematics and Computer
  Engineering from <a href="https://www.upc.edu/en">UPC</a> and I am currently working as a Software
  Engineer at Oracle.</p>
